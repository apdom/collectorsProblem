Question:

Given a 1 dimensional sidewalk of length L.
Suppose rain drops of diameter d fall on the sidewalk according to unif(0, L).
The drops can overlap, and the drops do not evaporate.
Let X be a random variable representing the number of drops until the sidewalk is completely wet.
Write simulation code to understand the distribution of X.

Files:

Plots.java - runs the simulation method and outputs results to csv
Sidewalk.java - contains main simulation method
Droplet.java - helper class for Sidewalk.java
Plots.R - takes the csv from Plots.java and creates plot
